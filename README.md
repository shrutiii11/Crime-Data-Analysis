# Crime-Data-Analysis
Visualizing and Analyzing Crime Trends in Los Angeles (2020â€“Present) This project uses public crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department to analyze, visualize, and animate crime patterns across time and locations. It explores trends by date, area, and crime type using Python-based data science and visualization tools.
# Crime Data Analysis: Los Angeles (2020â€“Present)

## Overview

This project analyzes crime data reported by the Los Angeles Police Department from 2020 to the present. It focuses on exploring crime patterns across time, locations, and crime types using Python. Key goals include:

- Identifying trends in crimes over time
- Detecting areas most prone to specific crimes
- Visualizing crime frequency through heatmaps, line plots, and animations
- Offering a dynamic, data-driven understanding of crime hotspots
